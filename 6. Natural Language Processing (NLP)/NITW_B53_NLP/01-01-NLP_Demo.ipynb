conglomerate Tencent has bought stake worth $264 million (about Rs 2,060 crore) in Flipkart from its co-founder Binny Bansal through its European subsidiary, according to official documents.\n","Singapore-headquartered e-commerce firm Flipkart has operations in India only.\n","Bansal holds around 1.84 per cent stake in Flipkart after selling part of his stake to Tencent Cloud Europe BV.\n","The transaction was completed on October 26, 2021 and was shared with the government authorities at the beginning of the current financial year.\n","\n","Post the transaction, Tencent arm holds 0.72 per stake in Flipkart which is valued at around $264 million, as per last valuation of $37.6 billion disclosed by the e-commerce firm in July 2021.\n","The company's valuation surged to $37.6 billion after raising $3.6 billion (about Rs 26,805.6 crore) in funding round led by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, CPP Investments, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart.\n","DisruptAD, Qatar Investment Authority, Khazanah Nasional Berhad as well as marquee investors Tencent, Willoughby Capital, Antara Capital, Franklin Templeton and Tiger Global also participated in the funding round.\n","The transaction between Bansal and Tencent took place after the July funding round.\n","Sources said the transaction took place in Singapore but Flipkart informed Indian authorities about it as a responsible entity and that the transaction does not fall under purview of 'Press Note 3' which calls for scrutiny of investment that any Indian company gets from countries sharing land border with India.\n","While there are several companies operating in India in which Tencent has made investment, the government has banned some gaming apps including PUBG Mobile, PUBG Mobile Lite which were published by Tencent Group.

The woman said he had to pay 30% commission of the total amount in the wallet to withdraw. His account was frozen.

It takes two parameters: pandas dataframe and name of the text column passed as `target` parameter. You can also pass a `list` containing text, in which case you don't need to pass `target` parameter. When setup is executed, following pre-processing steps are applied automatically:\n","\n","- **Removing Numeric Characters:** All numeric characters are removed from the text. They are replaced with blanks.<br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Removing Special Characters:** All non-alphanumeric special characters are removed from the text. They are also replaced with blanks.<br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Word Tokenization:** Word tokenization is the process of splitting a large sample of text into words. This is the core requirement in natural language processing tasks where each word needs to be captured separately for further analysis. __[Read More](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html)__ <br/>\n","<br/> \n","- **Stopword Removal:** A stop word (or stopword) is a word that is often removed from text because it is common and provides little value for information retrieval, even though it might be linguistically meaningful. Example of such words in english language are: \"the\", \"a\", \"an\", \"in\" etc. __[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)__ <br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Bigram Extraction:** A bigram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words. For example: word New York is captured as two different words \"New\" and \"York\" when tokenization is performed but if it is repeated enough times, Bigram Extraction will represent the word as one i.e. \"New_York\"  __[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram)__ <br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Trigram Extraction:** Similar to bigram extraction, trigram is a sequence of three adjacent elements from a string of tokens. __[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram)__ <br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Lemmatizing:** Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single word, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form. In English language, word appears in several inflected forms. For example the verb 'to walk' may appear as 'walk', 'walked', 'walks', 'walking'. The base form, 'walk', that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the lemma for the word. __[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)__ <br/>\n","<br/>\n","- **Custom Stopwords:** Many times text contains words that are not stopwords by the rule of language but they add no or very little information. For example, in this tutorial we are using the loan dataset. As such, words like \"loan\", \"bank\", \"money\", \"business\" are too obvious and adds no value. More often than not, they also add a lot of noise in the topic model. You can remove those words from corpus by using `custom_stopwords` parameter. <br/>\n","<br/>\n","\n","**Note :** Some functionalities in `pycaret.nlp` requires english language model.
